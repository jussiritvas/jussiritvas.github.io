        description: "I've been working on the lower level of our software stack. When I say lower level I mean the part where circuit is transformed from gates to pulses, transferred over the wire and the pulse playlists are distributed to the correct hardware and executed.\nI am very excited for what's coming in this part of the stack when we go towards fault-tolerant quantum computing.\nI believe also that this part of the stack contains very interesting software problems that need to be solved."

Our company was a online clothing rental platform where consumers had access to an unlimited wardrobe by monthly subscription or by one-time rentals.\nI created the platform using JAMStack architecture, relying on headless CMS and Stripe. I was proud that there was no downtime during the whole two years and the user feedback was really great. During Covid years we also pivoted towards another product `Clozeta Preloved`, which I was able to program in 3 months."
